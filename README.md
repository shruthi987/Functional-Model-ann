# Functional-Model-ann
ANN----Artificial Neural Networks
we use keras framework to build ANN model
3 types of ANN-----1)Sequential Model
                   2)Functional Model
                   3)Model Subclassing
Functional ---here we are separating each of them and passing them as a parameter
advantages:
          >can make any changes in any layer
          >can have 2 predictions
we have take load_iris dataset(1 o/p).
we have also taken diabetes.csv sample data, where we have 2 o/p predictions(BMI, Outcome).
here o/p predictions are BMI(Regression) and Outcome(Classification).
